## Before you start

This skill runs on the user's Devplan workspace.

1. Check that the Devplan tools are available. If your client loads tools on demand, search for "devplan" first. Never call a Devplan tool just to find out whether it exists.
2. If Devplan isn't connected, or a call fails with a sign-in error, say in one line that this needs Devplan connected, then follow `devplan-setup` from step 1. Stop this skill there.
3. Load company and personal context with `devplan-product-context`.
4. If the workspace is still being built (Devplan is connected but `list_repository_descriptions` and `list_workspace_projects` both come back empty), work from what exists and don't pad. On a dashboard, show the template's notice ("Devplan is still analyzing your sources. This fills in automatically as it finishes."). Anywhere else, say it in one line.
